## Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard üåÖ‚òÅÔ∏èüå°Ô∏è

## Description

This is a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. It uses AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.
